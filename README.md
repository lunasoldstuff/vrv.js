VRV.js was created by [stampylongr](https://github.com) (me) and [Sorurus](https://github.com/Sorurus) with the purpose of being a simple video downloader for [VRV](https://vrv.co). Some planned features are:

- Conversions of ```.m3u8``` files to ```.mp4``` videos.
- Integration with [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/).
- Ability to add VRV username and password to syntax.
- A more user-friendly client.

That's it for now!
